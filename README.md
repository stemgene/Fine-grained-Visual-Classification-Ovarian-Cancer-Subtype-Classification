# Ovarian-Cancer-Subtype-Classification

The goal of the UBC Ovarian Cancer subtypE clAssification and outlier detectioN (UBC-OCEAN) is to classify ovarian cancer subtypes. I will build a model trained on the world's most extensive ovarian cancer dataset of histopathology images obtained from more than 20 medical centers.

# Description

Ovarian carcinoma is the most lethal cancer of the female reproductive system. There are five common subtypes of ovarian cancer: high-grade serous carcinoma, clear-cell ovarian carcinoma, endometrioid, low-grade serous, and mucinous carcinoma. Additionally, there are several rare subtypes ("Outliers"). These are all characterized by distinct cellular morphologies, etiologies, molecular and genetic profiles, and clinical attributes. Subtype-specific treatment approaches are gaining prominence, though first requires subtype identification, a process that could be improved with data science.

Currently, ovarian cancer diagnosis relies on pathologists to assess subtypes. However, this presents several challenges, including disagreements between observers and the reproducibility of diagnostics. Furthermore, underserved communities often lack access to specialist pathologists, and even well-developed communities face a shortage of pathologists with expertise in gynecologic malignancies.

Deep learning models have exhibited remarkable proficiency in analyzing histopathology images. Yet challenges still exist, such as the need for a significant amount of training data, ideally from a single source. Technical, ethical, and financial constraints, as well as confidentiality concerns, make training a challenge. In this competition, you will have access to the most extensive and diverse ovarian cancer dataset of histopathology images from more than 20 centers across four continents.

My work could yield improved accuracy in identifying ovarian cancer subtypes. Better classification would enable clinicians to formulate personalized treatment strategies regardless of geographic location. This targeted approach has the potential to enhance treatment efficacy, reduce adverse effects, and ultimately contribute to better patient outcomes for those diagnosed with this deadly cancer.
